# Monero Nanopool Client
The Monero Nanopool is an interisting web app to interact with.  It uses websockets and JSON RPC messages to communicate between the pool servers and mining clients.

Unfortunately the nanopool websocket api is lacking in documentation.

This portion of the project is to document and explore the basic functionality of the api:
1. Login
2. Listen for new tasks
3. Report task results
